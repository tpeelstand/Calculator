Building an ASP.NET Calculator

Going through hour 4 of "Sam's teach yourself ASP.NET 4in 24 hours". THis chapter I will be building out a financial calculator. 

I had numberous commits to this project because I would working on getting Visual Studio's setup to work with GitHub and also testing to 
make sure Grunt was watching and autocompiling my Stylus files.

Everything seems good to go! Let's build a calculator!
